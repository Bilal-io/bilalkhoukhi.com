Serverless Framework depends on Knative to deploy a serverless function on OpenShift, and then all you need is to run `serverless deploy`

If you didn't already know, Serverless Framework supports Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, F#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP and Scala

## Prerequisites

- Knative deployed on your Openshift Cluster [Quick Guide](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/serverless/installing_serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.html)
- Serverless CLI installed on your local machine [Quicker Guide](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/)
- A project ready to be deployed

After all the prerequisites are met, let's get started.

First, we want to login to serverless, just type `serverless login` in your terminal, and it'll guide you.

Then, we'll need to clone a project running the command `serverless create -u <github-link>`, you can pick any of these [sample projects](https://github.com/serverless/examples) or setup your own. I will use `npx serverless init knative-express-starter` to create a sample project locally.

Serverless Framework, requires a file called `serverless.yml` as you can see it exists in all the sample projects.

The one I generated looks like this:

```yaml
app: knative-express-starter
name: knative-express-starter
component: knative

inputs:
  src: ./src
```

Nothing needs to change here other than the app and name values.

What we need to look at next is the `.env` file

Initially it looks like this:

```yaml
# Learn more about about the credentials needed
# to deploy your app https://github.com/serverless/components#credentials

# AWS:
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your access key>
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your secret access key>
```

And for Knative to work, it requires these environment variables, so we change it to:

```yaml
KUBERNETES_ENDPOINT=https://api.openshift.sample.com # or run oc whoami --show-server
KUBERNETES_PORT=6443
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN= # run oc whoami --show-token
KUBERNETES_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY=true
```

Now you can run `serverless deploy` or `serverless deploy -v` to display logs

You can also check the status of your deployment on [serverless.com](http://serverless.com) dashboard, or check your OpenShift Web Console, where your function will deploy to a newly created namespace equal to your app's name. e.g `knative-express-starter-sdaf1a`
